% returns the new configuration of cities with an optimal solution for the
% traveling salesman problem for n cities. 
%
%The input arguments are
% INPUTCITIES         - The cordinates for n cities are represented as 2
%                       rows and n columns and is passed as an argument for
%                       SIMULATEDANNEALING.
% INITIAL_TEMPERATURE - The initial temperature to start the
%                       simulatedannealing process.
% COOLING_RATE        - Cooling rate for the simulatedannealing process. 
%                       Cooling rate should always be less than one.
% THRESHOLD           - Threshold is the stopping criteria and it is the
%                       acceptable distance for n cities.
% NUMBEROFCITIESTOSWAP- Specify the maximum number of pair of cities to
%                       swap. As temperature decreases the number of cities
%                       to be swapped decreases and eventually reaches one
%                       pair of cities.
